# Substrate Overload Lipotoxic Liver Injury Model of NASH Pathogenesis

* Hepatocellular Injury <==> Repair
* PNPLA3 -- High Risk for NASH due to TG synthesis
* Hepatocyte can readily uptake fructose thus it makes it a key player in FFA formation

# Three-Dimensional Perfused Human In Vitro Model of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
**David Hughes**

* LiverChip
  * Spheroids
  * No Imaging 
  * Measured: Alb, Urea, AST, ALT LDH, Steatosis, Glutathione, Cyp 1A2, -2C9, -2D6 and -3A4 activity, FA Consumption, RNA Extracted, Adipokines
  * Media Condition: 5.5 mM (Low Glucose)
