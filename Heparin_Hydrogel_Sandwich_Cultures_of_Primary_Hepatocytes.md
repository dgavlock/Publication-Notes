* Culture Time: 24 days
* Experimental Readouts: Albumin, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Cytochrome P450, Bile Canaliculi, Morphology

## Abstract Summary

This paper explores PEG-DA as an alternative to collagen or Matrigel to make scaffolds for cultivating functional hepatocytes. The study looked at hepatocyte functionality as the marker of success. Heparin gel layers were fabricated via UV light induced thiol0ene coupling. There was sustained albumin secretion for three weeks, Cytochrome P450 was 1.6 times higher in the Heparin gels. PEG-DA/Heparin offers significant flexibility in terms of tuning mechanical properties, adjusting heparin content or introducing photolabile chemistries to promote gel degradation. 

## Method Notes

* Compound directly to cultures maintained in Collagen
* Cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1): PEG-DA/Heparin 2X Collagen at 22 days



## Results Notes

### General 

* Collagen and PEG-DA/Heparin are overall very comparable under static culture conditions with Rat Hepatocytes. 
* No information in this article to suggest how PEG-DA/Heparin would fair under flow conditions
* No information provided directly regarding the effect of radiation on the hepatocyte viability, but the battery of functional assays suggests that the radiation does not have any adverse effects.
* Use of Heparin may enhace hepatocyte function by allowing more access to Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)
* The ability to control stiffness/mechanical flexibility by modularity of PEG

### Functional Readouts

* PEG-DA/Heparin enhances P450
* Similar CMFDA between Collagen and PEG-DA/Heparin
* Similar Morphology between Collagen/PEG-DA (up to 3 weeks)

### Morphology

* Similar Albumin and Urea secretion (3 weeks)

## Questions to be Answered

* How would this gel perform under flow conditions?
* Would stiffness change with other added growth factors?
