## This file is the collection of publication links I am keeping to better track the scientific publications I have read:

* [Mutual Regulation of Tumour Vessel Normalization and Immunostimulatory Reprogramming](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5788037/)
	* Date Read: 8/8/18
	* Author: Xiang Ziang
	* Institution: Baylor
	* Important Points: Microenvironment determines ER expression and tumor growth; Ca+ creates a vicious cycle in MBC->Bone colonization, MBC cells can be genotyped into PPAGs and GPAGs


* [In Silico Labeling: Predicting Fluorescent Labels in Unlabeled Images](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29656897)
	* Date Read: 8/15/18
	* Author: Christiansen EM
	* Institution: Google
	* Important Points: Deep Neural Networks can accurately predict cell labels. Many features of specific cell types can bet determined, among them texture, health, location, and subcellular structures
