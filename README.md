# Publication-Notes
* This is a repo of all the notes I've taken on scientific publications! You can view or share these notes how you please!
* There is no gaurantee that the notes are 100% correct, that is why I will always link to the publications that the notes summarize.
* The notes will be on topics that vary, but will always be about scientific presentations
* The reason I am making this repository is to share my notes and the interesting publications that they summarize and to keep a log of the talks that I've been to so that I can refer my collegues to this repo if they would like to view the notes!
