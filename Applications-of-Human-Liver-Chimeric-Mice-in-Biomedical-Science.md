## Introduction

Humanized mice are created in two ways:
  1. Genetically-induced 
  2. Chemically induced --> Transplanted into the mice
  
Their mouse strain FRG (FAH, RAG-2 IL-2RG)
  * Works on the Tyrosine Catabolism pathway
    * 5 Steps
    * Acetone Intoxicates hepatocytes
      * Leathal in Neonatal situations 
 
 * These mice show 95% humanization in the liver with transplated human hepatocytes
 
 -----------------------------------------
 
 ## HBV
 
 * Investigated first as it is easy to characterize 
  * Human Liver Specific
  * Works well with Liver Chimeric Mice
  
## Hypercholesterolemia

* Chimeric mice get sick from HC human hepatocytes
  * This finding suggests that transplanting a diseased state of hepatocytes is possible in a chimeric mouse model
* Metabolic Readouts (Succinylaceton Urine) confirmed this result as well when compared with control

----------------------------------------------


## Model Issues 

Low chimerism in mice 
  1. Average of 47% humanization in most models
  2. 7.6 HSA level Average
  
***Mice cannot serve as a perfect model for human metabolism because they have many more cytochromes, thus better metabolic efficency***

As always I encourage anyone looking at these notes to read the associated literature for the specifics and to suggest a change in my notes if I have something wrong!
