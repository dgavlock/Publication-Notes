## Abstract Summary

Heparin was modified to have thiol groups by the modification of the caboxylic groups of heparin with cysteamine using carbodiimide chemistry. Thiol functional group was controlled from 10% to 60% of the available COOH groups, and the retained bioactivity of the modified heparin, characterized by its binding affinity to anthithrombin III, decreased with increasing functionalization. Then, the thiol-functionalized heparin was reacted with PEG diacrylate to form a hydrogel. The gelation kinetics and mechanical properties of the final gel state could be tuned by controlling cross-link density. 

## Method Notes
* PEG-DA was reacted with Hep-SH in PBS (degassed by N2 purging) to form a cross-linked heparin gel
## Results Notes

### General

* This is not a hepatocyte-specific paper; this is more of a method paper to highlight the process of generating and using thiol-heparin/PEG-DA to keep fibroblasts alive over a relatively short period of time
* One potential advantage is that gelation is NOT UV-dependent

## Questions to be Answered

* What is the rate of degradation of the hydrogel in physiological buffers
