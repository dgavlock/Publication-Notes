## Abstract

Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) has emerged as an innovative approach in model‐informed drug discovery and development, supporting program decisions from exploratory research through late‐stage clinical trials. In this commentary, we discuss the unique value of disease‐scale “platform” QSP models that are amenable to reuse and repurposing to support diverse clinical decisions in ways distinct from other pharmacometrics strategies.

## Review Notes

### Disease-Scale QSP

* PK/PD has reduced the time and cost of bringing new drugs to market
* QSP has been defined as "the quantative analysis of the dynamic interactions between drug(s) and a biological system that aims to understand the behavior of the system as a whole.."
* Earlier and more thorough testing of mechanisms of action of novel agents have been proposed as critical for reducing late stage drug development attrition
* QSP models integrate datasets from diverse studies, contexts, and spatiotemporal scales into a mathematical framework that reflects our knowledge of the system
* Models exploit integration, mechanistic representation to predict outcomes in untested scenarios, while also prioritizing  relevant biological detail over identifiability

### Disease Scale Platforms typically include

1. the interplay of multiple drug targets, pathways, and tissues in the disease
2. a representation of the untreated disease state and a broad range of disease phenotypes 
3. mechanistically link target modulation to biomarker changes and outcomes
4. allow comparisons against current standards of care
5. support multiple applications, such as evaluation of the impact on efficacy and/or safety of different novel monotherapy and combination therapy treatments and alternate study designs can be reused, adapted, and repurposed for new treatments, questions, and indications

### Immuno-oncology platform

* FDA approved breakthrough therapies that block immune "checkpoints" to promote antitumor immunity and establish durable responses, the potential of immunotherapy is being realized
  * Which checkpoints to target, how to optimize therapy timing and sequencing to take advantage of immune system dynamics, how therapeutic strategies should vary between indications, and how to best combine immunomodulatory mechanisms.
  * Mechanistic model of cancer-immunity cycle was developed
    * Initial focus for model development and application has been melanoma, inwhich clinical data are most abundant, with planned adaptation to other tumor types
    * The intitial pilot project simulated the blood and tumor microenvironment and response to approved I-O agents, ipilimumab and nivolumab
    * The second stage inwhcih the model was expanded to include a drainage sentinel lymp node and additional cell types, soluble factors, cellular targets, and therapies
    * The first stage demonstrated reasonable dynamic tragjectories in key biomarkers, including gamma interferon (IFN-y), CD8 T cells, CD4 regulatory T cells, and IL-10, and suggested potential pathways limiting therapeutic response to target engagement with concomitant or sequenced clinical dosing strategies.
    * Currently, the melanoma I-O QSP platform is being deployed to explore the efficacy of alternate ipilimumab and nivolumab therapeutic regimens
    * Other applications include investigating the requirement for maintenance therapy and exploring combinations and sequencing with anti-CD137, anti-GITR, anti-LAG3, and other therapies in clincial development at Bristol-Myers Squibb
 
## More Reading

* Find more at CPT: Pharmacometrics and Systems Pharmacology
* There is a continued need for open-source model dissemination to enable community and regulatory evaluation and use, and for public disclosure of the clinical impact of QSP platform models. These efforts will ultimately advance the broader adoption of this promising approach in clinical drug development
