## General Notes

* Coco-2 Cells cultured on Transwell for gut
* Perfusion system for liver
  * Liver system is a 3D model
  * Liver-adaptive immune model with PBMCs in transwell stimulated to produce cytokines including IFNy, downregulating hepatic function (albumin)
  * Interferon-stimulated genes were upregulated, clearing adenoviral infections to be cleared
* Xenobiotics given to gut and then liver
* Mulit-organ systems provide a tool to study in greater detail the key interactions between the gut, the liver and the immune system that drive pathologies including steatohepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma and viral hepatitis
