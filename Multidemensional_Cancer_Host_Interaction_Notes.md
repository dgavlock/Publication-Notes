# Notes on Multidemensional Cancer-Host Interaction during Metastasis

## Talk was divided into two parts: first on how the immune microenvironment varies across tumors (Heterogeneity) and second on the arrival of cancer cells to new environments (metastasis) and how that selects for resistances

### How the immune microenvironment varies across tumors 

* Breast cancer cells are heterogenious at multiple levels, meaning that each cell contributes different overall to the tumor microenvironment, thus causing each tumor to behave differently as well.

* Tumors recruit cell types and work like an organ all to themselves

* There are subpopulations of triple negative breast cancer cells with immune cell infiltration, thus are key players in the ability to metastisize. 
	* With in these subpopulations we also encounter heterogeniety of breast cancer cells
* There are is a split in genotypic expression along prognostic outcomes which we can confer physiological responses, the split groups were refered to as GPAGs and PPAGs 
	* GPAGs--Refered to the "good prognostic angiogenesis genes" and were correlated with normal vessel structure
	* PPAGs--Refered to the "poor prognostic angiogenesis" and were correlated with abnormal vessel structure
* High immune response in GPAGs with meant that tumor growth was suppressed, this led to the investigation of the PPAGs to better characterize what made the PPAGs more elusive to immune response
	* CD4KO mice were shown to have disruptive vessels characteristic of the PPAG genotype pointing to CD4 as a player in the characterization of the PPAG genotype
	* Schematic summary of CD4+-TL-mediated vessel normalization, and subsequent formation of positive feedback loop through cell-cell interaction, cytokine production and increased pericyte coverage. Checkpoint blockade therapy and antigen presentation enhance Th1-skewed CD4+-TL activation and promote the vessel normalization/immunostimulatory reprogramming positive feedback loop. 
* E0771 mouse with high macrophage:neutrophil ratio and anti-CTLA4 & anti-PD1 show supression, but tumor reoccurance


## How Arrival to New Environment (Metastatic Site) Selects for Resistant Cell Populations

* Estrogen Receptor Positive (ER+) generally have a better prognosis, but is still fatal over time and has a decent reoccurance rate
	* ER+ almost always metastisizes to the bone
		* Once in the bone there is a "vicious cycle" were the cancer-bone cell interaction feeds cancer growth
		* Breast Cancer Cells in the bone marrow have been detected and are usually ER- at the time, but are hypothesized to switch to ER+ once on the bone tissue
		* There are Bone-In-Culture Assays to detect test drugs on bone metastasis
* There is tight binding between cancer cells and osteogenic cells, thus showing the importance of E-Cadherin & N-Cadherin for the cell-cell interaction of the host-tumor site
* Gap junctions are also mediated by Ca+ influx from the osteogenic cells to the cancer cells
	* This led to the belief that Ca+ plays an important role in the colonization efforts of the cancer cells in the bone
	* Cx43 is a gap junction protein that facilitates the transfer of Ca+ from osteogenic cells to cancer cells
* As2O3 (Arsenic Trioxide) can block Ca+ induction from osteogenic cells to cancer cells, thus slowing colonization
* Metastatic breast cancer cells lose ER expression in bone
	* Thought to be silenced by EZH2
* **Big take away is that the microenvironment determines ER expression and tumor growth** 

## Questions to be answered

1. Is there a E-Cadherin Cx43 feedback loop?
2. Is EZH2 and ER expression participating in Ca+ supression?
